    "description": "Road to the capital of Turkey, Istanbul 🌆... 🇹🇷 Or is it! Ankara is the actual capital (gotcha, you forgot, right? 😜). However, Istanbul is indeed the largest city in the country, with four historical zones listed as a World Heritage site by UNESCO! 🌍 Once known as Byzantium to the Greeks and Constantinople to the Eastern Roman Empire, Istanbul marks the geographical gateway between Europe and Asia 🚪. It's this remarkable city that you'll have the chance to explore with the famous Istanbul Marathon, one of the most attractive in the world, along with its 15 km distance. Get ready: it's a festive, popular, and unmissable event for Turkish and international athletics! 🤌",

    "description": "Scheduled annually in mid-October, right after Berlin 🇩🇪 and before Venice 🎭, Dublin 🍻, Frankfurt, and Valencia 🇪🇸 (just to give you a clearer picture of the European marathon calendar this fall 😉), the TCS Amsterdam Marathon, whose inaugural race was held in 1975, offers a rather classic but extremely well-organized race format! 👏 On the agenda of this internationally renowned foot race (the only one in the Netherlands 🇳🇱 alongside the Rotterdam Marathon): 3 distances. You can choose between an 8 km, a half-marathon, and a marathon, the latter being, of course, the crown jewel 👸 of the event.",

    "description": "Marvejols-Mende offers a magnificent city-to-city race, spanning 22.4 km. Often referred to as the Semi-Marathon Marvejols-Mende, it demands more effort than your usual half marathons! 😅 This legendary event presents a significant challenge with its many tough rolling hills 💪. It's not the place to break your personal record 😬. However, if you're looking to push your limits, this race is perfect for you. 😎 Its 650 m elevation gain will show no mercy on your calves! 😂 Fear not if long distances aren't your forte; this challenge can be done in relay. And that's not all! There are also 2 races for children: the Baby marathon and the Mini marathon 👶.",
